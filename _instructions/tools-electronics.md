# Tools for Electronics Work

## Tools

To assemble the electronics parts you will require the following tools:

* Soldering iron
* Solder
* Solder sucking tape (for correcting mistakes)
* Wire strippers
* Wire cutters (Wire strippers often include wire cutters)
* A small vice (non-machining vice as you don't want to damage the board). For example, [this one available from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Aven-17010-Adjustable-Circuit-Holder/dp/B07D9R54XZ) and [from many other sellers](https://www.google.com/search?&tbm=shop&q=pcb+clamp+holder&tbs=vw:l,mr:1,price:1,ppr_max:40).
* At least 1 multimeter (2 would be ideal)
* Alligator clip cables to connect the multimeter to various points on the PCB.
* Good overhead lighting or lamps
* Long nose pliers

Optional

* Kapton tape to hold parts down while soldering (highly recommended)
* A DC 12V power supply, to be used for testing the voltage regulators and relays. You can use the UPS which you prepare as part of the build, or you may use a bench power supply.
* A DC 5V power supply, to be used for testing the switching of the relays
  * TODO Write instructions that actually use this early in the process, i.e. before we can use an Arduino
* A computer (the NUC)
