# Glossary of Terms

* [Arcminute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc) - 1 60th of a Degree; abbreviated with a single quote or an apostrophe: **’**. The Sun appears about 32 arcminutes across, or 0.53 degrees, and the moon is just slightly smaller in appearance, at 31 arcminutes across.
* [Arcsecond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute_and_second_of_arc) - 1 60th of an Arcminute; abbreviated with a double quote or double apostrophe: **″**. For PAN001, the pixels are about 10 arcseconds (10″) across.
* [Celestial Sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_sphere)
* [DC - Direct Current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_current)
* [DEC - Declination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declination). See RA below.
* [Degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(angle)) - Angular measurement; abbreviated with a degree sign: **°**. The field of view of the PAN001 cameras is approximately 10° x 15°, or 150 square degrees.
* DSLR - digital single lens reflex (camera)
* Equatorial Mount
* GB - gigabyte
* German Equatorial Mount
* Home position - TODO
* kg - kilograms
* lbs - pounds
* mm - millimeters
* [NUC - Intel Next Unit of Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Unit_of_Computing), a small computer
* PANOPTES - Panoptic Astronomical Networked Observatories for a Public Transiting Exoplanets Survey
* Parked position - TODO
* PCB - [Printed Circuit Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board)
* [RA - Right Ascension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_ascension); along with Declination, these are the measurements astronomers use to specify where in the sky a celestial object is located. RA is analogous to Longitude, but applied to the celestial sphere rather than the surface of the earth.
* [STEM - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics)
* [TESS - Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transiting_Exoplanet_Survey_Satellite)
* Unit - A single PANOPTES robotic telescope is also known as a PANOPTES unit.
