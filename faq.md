  - question: What is Project PANOPTES?
    answer: |-
      PANOPTES (Panoptic Automated Network of Observatories for a Public Transiting Exoplanets Survey) is a citizen science project which aims to build a worldwide network of low cost, robotic telescopes used to detect transiting exoplanets.

      The name is a [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym) which references [Argus Panoptes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_Panoptes), a mythical creature of ancient Greece with the ability to see in all directions at all times. Our ambition is to build a collaborative, world-wide network of observatories that will survey the night sky for nearby exoplanets.
