# Google Summer of Code 2019 - Project Ideas

## Scheduler Updates

The PANOPTES scheduler is currently a simple weighted dispatch scheduler that is ignorant of the rest of the PANOPTES network. In order to support our next phase of the survey we would like to make some improvements to the scheduler. These improvements will help to support both “survey” and “follow-up” modes of operation. The scheduler should be able to handle both network connected units (i.e. “give me the best target right now”) as well as offline units (i.e. “give me good targets for the next 6 months”).

Suggested Milestones:

1. **Simple cloud-based scheduler to return a single target for a single unit.** Most of the mechanics of this are done, it would involve setting up Google Cloud Functions and gluing some pieces together. First steps would involve becoming familiar with existing setup.
2. **Add “survey” and “follow-up” distinctions for single unit.**
3. **Incorporate multiple units into target decision.** This is mostly useful for follow-up mode, where we want to try and schedule a target to be observed simultaneously (or sequentially) by multiple units as appropriate.
