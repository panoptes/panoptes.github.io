## How can you participate?

Join our group, and participate in any way you wish, according to your area of expertise and/or taste. You can build a robotic camera yourself (and improve our design), explore new hardware solutions, write/improve software, come up with a new idea to use the robotic cameras, get other citizen scientists to join, analyze existing images, etc. How will you contribute to PANOPTES?
