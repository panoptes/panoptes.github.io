- description: Due to the simplicity and low cost a PANOPTES "unit" can be built quickly
    and easily by students or amateur scientists. PANOPTES is designed from the ground
    up to be a citizen science project which will involve the public in all aspects
    of the science, from data acquisition to reduction. An entire exoplanet finding
    telescope can be built for about $5000 USD.

- description: The philosophy behind the PANOPTES hardware and software design is
    to use as many commercial off the shelf (COTS) parts as possible as these are
    generally inexpensive and easily acquired. In addition, the PANOPTES design is
    kept as simple as possible as this makes the build process easier and means that
    the final product is more reliable.

  description: The PANOPTES community spans the world, from the founding members in
    Hawai'i to designers, builders and scientists in Europe, Australia, and North
    and South America. We're looking forward to our members in Africa and Asia! We
    use a variety of means to communicate, including a Google Group for announcements
    and a forum for discussions.
