Preethi is a postdoctoral scholar at Subaru Telescope. She did her PhD on the distribution of the interstellar medium in India. She began her journey in astronomy as an amateur astronomer with sky-high hope in a heavily light polluted city. She likes using astronomy as a tool to engage school children in interactive sessions and hands-on activities, to help them learn science and develop a scientific temper. She also enjoys using her crowd funded telescope to conduct public sky watches and learn astrophotography.
