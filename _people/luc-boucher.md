Luc got involved with Panoptes in 2015 mostly to support the electronics design and then became a unit builder when he moved to Chile. Luc graduated from Engineering school in Electronics (Microelectronics & Instrumentation) in 2002 and obtained his PhD in Microelectrnics and Image Sensors in 2007. From there he worked in the space industry and ground based astronomy (currently at Gemini South Telescope). He enjoys his growing family, technical challenges and playing the Blues.
