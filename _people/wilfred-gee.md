Wilfred has been working with PANOPTES since he was an undergraduate at the University of Hawai'i Hilo where he helped out with the initial baseline and prototype builds and was mostly responsible for [POCS](https://github.com/panoptes/POCS), the software that runs the units.  Wilfred then went down to Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia to complete his Master's Thesis and is currently working on his PhD, helping to build the image processing algorithm and data pipeline.
