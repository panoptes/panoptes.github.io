What better way to celebrate the successful build of PAN012 than with a party on the roof at Caltech?

Not only did PAN012 get built in 10 weeks by two students, but they were also able to obtain to recover a full transit of HD189733 right from this very same rooftop! Definitely a good way to end the summer!

Congratulations to Aru and Montu for a job well done!

Check out the photo album for more pictures and video of the launch party.
