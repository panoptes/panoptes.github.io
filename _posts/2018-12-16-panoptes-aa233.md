The [American Astronomical Society's 233rd Meeting](https://aas.org/meetings/aas233 "Link: https://aas.org/meetings/aas233") is coming up and Project PANOPTES is getting ready! One of our undergraduate interns will be presenting a poster of the unit she built (PAN012) in just 10 weeks at Caltech. We'll also be giving a science talk complete with shiny new light curves using data obtained from PAN012 during the internship. Look for us there!
