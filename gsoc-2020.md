# Google Summer of Code 2020 - Project Ideas

## POCS CLI Interface

[PANOPTES Observatory Control System (POCS)](https://github.com/panoptes/POCS.git) and the PANOPTES Environmental Analysis System (PEAS) are currently controlled via the "POCS Shell" and the "PEAS Shell", which are [`cmd`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html)-based CLI applications. We would like to convert this to a non-blocking command line tool that can handle both POCS and PEAS related items.

Please see the [Github Issue](https://github.com/panoptes/POCS/issues/954) for more details.

Suggested Milestones:

1. **Develop consistent interface** We would need to identify all of the currently known commands that we want and create consistently terminology for each of the various device. For example, `pocs weather load` and `pocs control_board load` vs `pocs weather init`, etc. In some cases this is straight-forward but the key would be defining the consistency based on usage.
2. **PEAS component** Convert the existing PEAS shell to the new cli.
3. **POCS component** Convert the existing POCS shell to the new cli.
3. **Help define new features** Have conversations with existing builders and operators to defined desired features. For instance, having ways to verify various interfaces would be nice and is currently not possible with either the PEAS or POCS shell (e.g. `pocs devices discover`)

Difficulty: Medium

Skills: Python, Linux, Docker

## Scheduler Updates

The PANOPTES scheduler is currently a simple weighted dispatch scheduler that is ignorant of the rest of the PANOPTES network. In order to support our next phase of the survey we would like to make some improvements to the scheduler. These improvements will help to support both “survey” and “follow-up” modes of operation. The scheduler should be able to handle both network connected units (i.e. “give me the best target right now”) as well as offline units (i.e. “give me good targets for the next 6 months”).

Suggested Milestones:

1. **Simple cloud-based scheduler to return a single target for a single unit.** Most of the mechanics of this are done, it would involve setting up Google Cloud Functions and gluing some pieces together. First steps would involve becoming familiar with existing setup.
2. **Add “survey” and “follow-up” distinctions for single unit.**
3. **Incorporate multiple units into target decision.** This is mostly useful for follow-up mode, where we want to try and schedule a target to be observed simultaneously (or sequentially) by multiple units as appropriate.

Difficulty: Medium

Skills: Python, Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Functions)
