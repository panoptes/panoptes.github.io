Note: The baseline design is meant to be assembled by anyone with a basic knowledge of electronics, computers, and astronomy, and a taste for building things/tinkering. There is no need to machine parts, and only standard tools are required (you will need a drill, screwdrivers, voltmeter). All electronics are readily available, and only need to be mounted and wired together.

Please note, however, that some components do require the use of basic hand tools and electrical wiring. Always use caution when dealing directly with a PANOPTES unit.
