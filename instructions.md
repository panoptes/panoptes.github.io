# Building a PANOPTES Unit

{% include note.html text="The baseline design is meant to be assembled by anyone with a basic knowledge of electronics, computers, and astronomy, and a taste for building things/tinkering. There is no need to machine parts, and only standard tools are required (you will need a drill, screwdrivers, voltmeter). All electronics are readily available, and only need to be mounted and wired together. <br> <br> Please note, however, that some components do require the use of basic hand tools and electrical wiring. Always use caution when dealing directly with a PANOPTES unit." %}


## PANOPTES Build Instructions

The instructions are being very actively updated,
so rather than publish them on the
website we are using Google Docs to edit and review them.
The top-level document is
[Building a Project PANOPTES Robotic Telescope](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/18nDDY4hEiUnkAqFX-mvez379OQISXoeNOMg7GjpgS4E/edit),
located in a Google Drive folder called
[All Instructions](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qgJHwwgDPWFXqGLd3rqZEdGeuVE0n7jd).
The [latest parts list](complete_parts_list.html) is a Google Spreadsheet.

Please <a href="mailto:info@projectpanoptes.org">Contact Us</a> if you would like to
build a unit and we will help you with figuring out which versions to use and what
parts to order.

## OLDER Build Instructions

These are the mechanical fabrication instructions for the design as of January, 2017.
They should *not* be used unless you already purchased the parts for that version of
the design.
